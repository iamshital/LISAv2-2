# Description:
#	This script was created to automate the testing of VCPU online or offline.
#   This script will verify if all the CPUs can be offline by checking
#	the /proc/cpuinfo file.
#	The VM is configured with 4 CPU cores as part of the setup script,
#	as each core can't be offline except vcpu0 for a successful test pass.
